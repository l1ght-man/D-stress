# Ethics and Responsible Use

## Purpose of This Tool

D-stress is an educational tool designed to help students, researchers, and security professionals understand how distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks work. The goal is to build knowledge about attack methods so that better defenses can be developed.

## Acceptable Use

You may use this tool only under the following conditions:

1. **On systems you own** - You have full legal ownership of the target infrastructure
2. **On systems with explicit written permission** - You have documented authorization from the system owner
3. **In isolated lab environments** - Your test network is completely separated from public networks
4. **For educational purposes** - You are learning about security concepts in a controlled setting

## Unacceptable Use

Do not use this tool:

1. **Against any system you do not own or control** - This includes websites, servers, or networks belonging to other people or organizations
2. **Against production systems** - Even systems you own, if they serve real users or critical functions
3. **To cause harm or disruption** - Any intent to damage, disrupt, or deny service to legitimate users
4. **To test without documentation** - Always have written authorization before testing any system
5. **In violation of laws** - Unauthorized computer access and denial of service attacks are criminal offenses in most jurisdictions

## Legal Notice

DDoS attacks against systems without authorization are illegal in most countries. Laws include but are not limited to:

- **United States**: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- **United Kingdom**: Computer Misuse Act
- **European Union**: Directive on Attacks against Information Systems
- **Other jurisdictions**: Similar laws exist worldwide

Violating these laws can result in criminal charges, fines, and imprisonment.

## Best Practices

### Before Testing

1. Document what systems you will test
2. Ensure complete isolation from production networks
3. Set up monitoring to observe the effects
4. Have a plan to stop the test if needed
5. Keep records of authorization

### During Testing

1. Monitor system health continuously
2. Be prepared to stop immediately if unexpected issues occur
3. Keep tests within your planned scope
4. Document observations for learning

### After Testing

1. Review what you learned
2. Document any vulnerabilities discovered
3. Implement fixes for issues found
4. Clean up test data and configurations

## Reporting Issues

If you discover security issues in this tool itself, please report them responsibly by opening an issue on the project repository.

## No Warranty

This tool is provided without any warranty. The authors are not responsible for any consequences resulting from its use, including but not limited to:

- System damage or data loss

## Final Statement

Use this tool to learn, to build better defenses, and to improve security. Do not use it to harm others or break laws. The knowledge you gain should be used to protect systems, not to attack them.

If you are unsure whether your intended use is appropriate, do not proceed. Seek guidance from experienced security professionals or legal counsel.
